# Angular 2 Todo App

Angular 2 is not packaged or ready for production... but this is a todo app with it.

### Installation

1. `$ npm install -g serve`
2. `$ serve`
3. `localhost:8080`

### Installation with your own Angular build

1. Clone angular2/angular2 somewhere on your disk.
2. Follow the instructions for Angular 2 and `gulp build` there.
3. `ln -s ~/angular/dist/js/dev deps/ng` in the root of this repo.
4. `$ npm install -g serve`
5. `$ serve`
6. Update systemjs path from 'deps/angular2' to 'deps/ng'
7. Write your AtScript code in app/ folder
8. `localhost:8080`

### Static deps
(already included in the deps folder)
1. The latest version of traceur.js (modified to support atscript out of the box).
2. The latest version of system.js
3. The latest version of es6-module-loader.js
4. The latest version of zone.js (and long-stacktrace-zone.js)

### Hacks
Due to bug in system.js and traceur integration, options are not picked up,
(TODO:rado file a bug and put a link here). To support atscript, we manually
edited the atscript flags in `traceur.js` (see `index.html` for the names of the flags.)


### TODO
 * Fix filters
 * Create Flux version
 * Refactor Firebase todoStorage into TodoStorage service
 * Refactor style management
 * Add server for FastBoot
